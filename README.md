# Smoke Detector
this is an project for final project submission of the DataTalksClub MLOps ZoomCamp 2024.

## The Problem Statement

So given the informations from the different sensors found in an smoke detector can we come up with an machine learning model which can monitor the sensor's data and predict when the smoke alarm should detect smoke.

## Parts

- [X] initial experiment notebook
